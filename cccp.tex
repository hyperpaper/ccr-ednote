\begin{abstract}
	Drawing on discussions at various venues, we envision a publishing ecosystem
	for Internet science, supporting publications that are self-contained,
	interactive, multi-level, open, and collaborative. These publications, which
	we dub \emph{hyperpapers}, not only address issues with reproducibility and
	verifiability of research in Internet science and measurement, but have the
	potential to increase the impact of our work and change how collaborations
	work in the field. This note announces initial experiments with Internet
	measurement hyperpapers with the help of common, tested technologies in data
	science and software development, and is a call to action to others to come
	build out this vision with us.

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:intro}

Scientific papers were born as a means to share novel scientific knowledge.
However, over time publications have also become the main metric for career
advancement. This shift has influenced the whole publishing process, from the
generation of ideas, data and results to how they are shared. If we step back
and look at the currently established process for scientific paper authoring and
publishing, including conventions and formats, it is clear there is room for
optimization for the good of science and education (e.g.,  have we struck the
right balance between confidentiality and openness? Are there opportunities from
recent technologies and collaborative practices that we can leverage?)

Discussion at various venues, including the CAIDA AIMS workshop in March 2018
\cite{aims-presentation} and the seminar ``Encouraging Reproducibility in
Scientific Research of the Internet`` at Schloss Dagstuhl in October 2018
\cite{dagstuhl-site}, identified issues with the publishing ecosystem through
which Internet measurement studies are disseminated that have an impact on
reproducibility and verifiability of Internet science.

\textbf{Problems we are facing today.} The current publication ecosystem
discourages incremental work by keeping the trade-off between required effort
and consequent gain heavily unbalanced.  On one hand, the scarcity of data,
tools and documentation to make research studies reproducible, raises the bar
for building upon peers' work.  One the other hand, we often put
disproportionate emphasis on novelty, sometimes leading to rejecting valid work
that `merely' extends previous results.  This leads to a vicious circle in
which, there is also little incentive for researchers to release artefacts for
others to work with.  Our research community has recently boosted efforts to
break this pattern.  Some venues in our field are starting to experiment with
artefacts such as code and data being submitted together with papers. While this
is far better than the common status quo of boutique code running on secret
data, these efforts are more suited to address archival requirements than those
of repeatability and verifiability. 

Even when artefacts are provided, problems remain. Tooling support is lacking
to help reviewers to efficiently verify these artefacts as part of the paper
review process, for example through repetition of experiments or analysis. The
difficulty this causes makes it difficult to make partial verification of
results during review the norm.

A culture of secrecy, both due to conditions of access on proprietary data
sources as well as to the tradition of establishing academic priority, adds
further barriers to scientific inquiry. Dead-ends and negative results stay
secret within the groups that find them. Researchers new to the field, and those
without connections to established cliques of collaborators, can find it hard to
get started in impactful Internet measurement. 

It is not the goal of this note to advocate for the immediate death of the
current publication process. Indeed, this process performs a valuable gatekeeper
function, both by providing incentives for authors to submit papers for review
and for reviewers to review them, as well as for bringing work from smaller
communities (in our case, Internet measurement) to larger audiences. The spirit
of our proposal is instead to suggest ways in which we, as a community, can
address the issues above while retaining positive aspects of the current
publication process.

\section{A Vision for the Future}
\label{sec:vision}

We propose to leverage recent developments in platforms and tools for data
science and scientific collaboration to build an experimental publishing
ecosystem for Internet measurements based on {\em hyperpapers}. The technical
details of this experiment are left to future work, but the outlines of the
properties of these papers already seem clear:

\textbf{Hyperpapers are interactive and self-contained.} Ideally, a full
hyperpaper contains all the data from which results, plots, and conclusions in
the paper are drawn, as well as source code implementing the analytic tasks
distilling those results from the raw source data. A hyperpaper is interactive,
allowing both changes to the raw source data and to the analysis code to be
reflected in the analytic products (tables, charts, etc.) in the paper,
supporting easy exploratory analysis of a dataset and/or measurement analysis
methodology as well as incremental changes to published work. The hyperpaper
includes one or more rendered versions, both for compatibility with existing
publishing channels (e.g., PDF) and to minimize the requirements for the 
readers who will not want to use the paper's interactive features or whose
devices do not allow it. Accessibility is thus maintained at least at the
current level, although we emphasize that this is another area where improvement
is needed.

The raw source data may be included with the hyperpaper either by value or by
reference, and the analysis code can be configured to run either on a local
machine or on some specified remote infrastructure. Hyperpapers can also require
credentials to enable their interactivity, in order to support arrangements
where raw and/or intermediate data is subject to access control.

\textbf{Hyperpapers are multilevel.} The initial view a reader will have of a
full hyperpaper includes the typical prose of a paper (abstract, introduction,
explanation of the questions answered, description of the methodology, results,
graphs, and so on). Analysis products, such as charts and tables, can be
expanded to show how they were derived.

However, the paper can also be expanded in other ways. A section of prose may
be linked to an alternate view, information for an alternate audience, related
content, or allow to drill down on some interesting result. For example, the
paper could contain an executive summary describing the utility of its insights
for the general public, network operators, regulators, and so on; a methodology
could be expanded to tell an expanded narrative of roads not taken, or
unsuccessfully taken, and why; or an introduction could be expanded with
introductory information on a measured protocol not necessary for practitioners
in the field but useful for students just learning it; and so on.  These sorts
of expansions would replace the creation of multiple papers on a subject to
multiple venues, e.g.~\cite{Dhamdhere18} and \cite{Clark18}.

Taken to its logical conclusion, multilevel hyperpapers allow a full explanation
and report on a research project's activity and the evolution of the chain of
hypotheses, addressing the dearth of negative results, while maintaining
narrative coherence and conciseness in the paper's main ``trunk'' While this
opens up new questions, e.g., for page counts and the review process, this
could be addressed by considering all extensions beyond this trunk as appendices
for review purposes.

\textbf{Hyperpapers are open and collaborative.} The interactive,
self-contained, and multilevel nature of hyperpapers enables ---indeed, may
require--- entirely new ways of working together as researchers. Starting
incremental work on a paper, or beginning to verify and reproduce it, becomes a
simple matter of forking it and given permission to access the data. To the extent
that the hyperpaper infrastructure is integrated with a collaboration platform,
papers can become open and living projects, with researchers performing
associated work, interdisciplinary co-authors writing expansions for specific
audiences beyond the usual networking conference audience, and even reviewers
becoming part of a long-running, data-centered conversation about a particular
hypothesis of how the Internet works.

\section{How do we get there?}
\label{sec:how}

As in all things scientific, by standing on the shoulders of giants. While this
vision may seem like science fiction, we submit that enough of the underlying
infrastructure behind this vision exists that rudimentary experimental
hyperpapers for Internet measurements can be written today.

The perennial problem of setting up environments for data analysis without
needing to replicate a full toolchain with dependencies from scratch is
partially solved today by virtualization and containerization tools such as
Vagrant and Docker. Problems of scale are addressed by the easy (if sometimes
costly) widespread availability of cloud infrastructure from multiple
providers.  Integration of data analytics with authoring environment
interleaving text and interactive visualizations is supported by data analysis
notebooks such as JupyterLab and Apache Zeppelin. GitHub has emerged as the de
facto standard for integrating version control of digital artefacts with a
collaboration environment, and its model of working is suited to open
collaborative papers as we envision them, which have a fair amount in common
with the long-running open-source projects GitHub was originally built to
support. Of course, all of these technologies are supported by the web
platform, decades of continuous investment in which has brought us to a world
where almost all of the work of research can be done in a standard browser.

We have identified two main gaps in technical infrastructure necessary for a
full initial realization of this vision:

\begin{itemize}
	
	\item First, while some research studies can be done with data or models
that can easily be stored in an ad-hoc format within the hyperpaper itself,
large-scale Internet measurement studies need access to large data sets mediated
through some interface. This exists for certain data sources (e.g., the RIPE
Atlas and the BGPStream APIs), but a full realization would require the creation
and standardization of interfaces for retrieval of data and metadata for each
broad type of measurement activity.

	\item Second, the distribution of rendered versions of papers is currently
	possible for scientific notebook environments, but these render to a webpage
	that is not necessarily optimized for accessibility. Tooling to render a
	view of hyperpaper as a PDF according to the visual style for a given venue,
	for example, is necessary to support the full multi-rendering functionality
	of the vision above. We consider this a simple matter of engineering,
	though.

\end{itemize}

Addressing these gaps will take time; in the meantime, the authors are currently
working to build initial hyperpaper versions of some of their previous and
current work, one of which~\cite{Trammell17} has already been built using some
of the technologies we identify as appropriate for hyperpapers. We welcome
community collaboration as we develop it into an architecture document for an
initial realization of a hyperpaper platform; see our GitHub organization at
\url{https://github.com/hyperpaper}.
